# MAP — Establish Context and Identify Risks

- The MAP function enables negative risk prevention and informs decisions for processes such as model management, and initial go/no-go decisions about whether an AI solution is needed
- Outcomes in MAP are the basis for the **MEASURE** and **MANAGE** functions — without contextual knowledge, risk management is difficult to perform
- After completing MAP, organizations should have sufficient contextual knowledge about AI system impacts to inform an initial **go/no-go decision** about whether to design, develop, or deploy an AI system
- Implementation is enhanced by incorporating perspectives from a diverse internal team and engagement with those external to the team

# Trustworthiness — Seven Characteristics of Trustworthy AI

<!-- competency: trust-overview -->
## Trustworthiness — Overview {#key_takeaways .weight-high}

- For AI systems to be trustworthy, they need to be responsive to a multiplicity of criteria that are of value to interested parties
- Trustworthiness is a social concept that ranges across a spectrum and is **only as strong as its weakest characteristic**
- Characteristics influence each other — tradeoffs between them are common (e.g., accuracy vs. privacy, transparency vs. security)
- Trustworthiness characteristics are **socio-technical in nature** — rooted in both technical aspects of AI and the social context in which AI systems are developed and deployed
- **Valid & Reliable** is the foundation — displayed as the platform under the other six characteristics; necessary condition for all trustworthiness
- **Accountable & Transparent** is a vertical cross-cutting characteristic — relates to and supports all other characteristics
- Understanding and treatment of characteristics depends on an **AI actor's particular role** within the lifecycle

<!-- competency: trust-seven-characteristics -->
## Seven Trustworthiness Characteristics {#glossary .weight-high}

- **Valid & Reliable** : The necessary foundation. Validation confirms that requirements for a specific intended use have been fulfilled. Reliability means the AI system performs as required without failure. The base condition shown as the platform under the other six characteristics — necessary for all other trustworthiness claims to hold.
- **Safe** : AI systems should not, under defined conditions, lead to a state in which human life, health, property, or the environment is endangered. Requires responsible design and deployment practices, clear information provision to enable responsible human use, and documentation of residual risk based on empirical evidence.
- **Secure & Resilient** : Resilient systems withstand unexpected adverse events or changes and degrade safely and gracefully. Secure systems prevent unauthorized access and use. Security includes resilience but also encompasses protocols to avoid, protect against, respond to, and recover from attacks.
- **Accountable & Transparent** : A cross-cutting, vertical characteristic. Transparency reflects the extent to which information about an AI system and its outputs is available to individuals interacting with it. Accountability presupposes transparency and relates to all other characteristics. The role of AI actors should be considered when seeking accountability for the outcomes of AI systems.
- **Explainable & Interpretable** : Explainability refers to a representation of the mechanisms underlying AI systems' operation. Interpretability refers to the meaning of AI systems' output in the context of their designed functional purpose. Together they help users gain deeper insights into the functionality and trustworthiness of the system. Transparency can answer "what happened"; explainability answers "how"; interpretability answers "why."
- **Privacy-Enhanced** : Privacy refers generally to the norms and practices that help to safeguard human autonomy, identity, and dignity — including freedom from intrusion, limiting observation, or individuals' agency to consent to disclosure or control of aspects of their identities. Privacy values should guide choices for AI system design, development, and deployment.
- **Fair — with Harmful Bias Managed** : Fairness in AI includes concerns for equality and equity by addressing issues such as harmful bias and discrimination. Standards of fairness can be complex and difficult to define because perceptions of fairness differ among cultures and may shift depending on application. Systems in which harmful biases are mitigated are not necessarily fair.

<!-- competency: trust-bias-categories -->
## Three Categories of AI Bias {#glossary .weight-medium}

- **Systemic bias** : Bias present in AI datasets, the organizational norms, practices, and processes across the AI lifecycle, and the broader society that uses AI systems. Can occur in the absence of prejudice, partiality, or discriminatory intent.
- **Computational and statistical bias** : Bias present in AI datasets and algorithmic processes, often stemming from systematic errors due to non-representative samples. Can occur in the absence of discriminatory intent.
- **Human-cognitive bias** : Bias that relates to how an individual or group perceives AI system information to make a decision or fill in missing information, or how humans think about purposes and functions of an AI system. Omnipresent in decision-making processes across the AI lifecycle including design, implementation, operation, and maintenance.
